Hi Anthony,

If you think you could do the job in the evenings and weekends before December we would be happy to count with your services.

We are an organisation participated by many other organisations distributed around Europe. We want to have though a consistent look and feel. It would be easy if we all could use Drupal, but the reality is we use different technologies or CMSs. Then we are aiming at providing a simple HTML template that can be easily adopted and implemented by different organisations in their own website framework.

We started to make a new Drupal theme ... http://178.79.185.223/website/ ... following an agreed guideline. We decided to adopt a style very similar to one of the participant organisations ... http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ . EBI already got a HTML template including few examples. An important feature of this template is that the top header and the footer content is centralised, so this content is always the same across our different organisations. Most of this functionality can be copied from EBI. EBI provides additional documentation for developer in their website guidelines. To me this is great but a bit too much. I think we could focus on few important points like navigation, grid and layouts, icons and maybe few others. As well something we could copy from EBI.

This is what we are aiming to achieve and this would be your role if accept the job. It would be important to get this job done asap ideally before December.

We would like to continue with your service and help us to improve our Drupal theme to make it work for mobile devices. This is something we are not in a rush and it could happen after you finish the first job.

Let me know if you would be interested and an estimate of how long you think it would take. I would be happy to meet an evening or during the weekend to talk about details after this half term.

Best regards,
Rafael
